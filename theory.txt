AIM : 

       Design a system for home security systems,
 such that whenever someone approaches the gate,
 the LED starts blinking once every 100 ms.

Appratus Used :  


               LED , Arduino , Ultrasonic sensor , wires .



Theory : 


         Ultrasonic ranging module HC - SR04 provides non-contact measurement function,
the ranging accuracy can reach .The modules includes ultrasonic transmitters, 
receiver and control circuit.
This is a simple example of using the ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)
 in Arduino where we will turn on a led with the variation of distance
 and print the distance from an object to the serial monitor. 



calculation :    Distance = (duration/2) / 29.1

Learning outcome :    how to use ultrasonic sensor.  


Source of error : connection should not be correct.


Result :   LED starts blinking once every 100 ms.
